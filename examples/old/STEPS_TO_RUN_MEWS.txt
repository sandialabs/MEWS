Most of these examples are outdated. We provide the following as the current template for use of MEWS:

Run - many manual inputs need changing. 
1. worcester_example.py

This generates solution_files that can subsequently be used.
You want to check to make sure that all of the fits looks good. You can access 

2. generate_files_from_solution_example.py

 -- This uses the solution files to produce epw weather files

3. worcester_heat_wave_analysis.py

 -- This runs EnergyPlus and analyzes the results per our newest paper to be published in "Science and Technology of the Built Environment"

Runs in two steps. Must change only_post_process = False to run E+ and switch back to true to procduce the plots of everything. 
If you have already run E+, this script will not rerun unless you delete the files where energyplus runs are. It therefore can restart
if it gets interrupted.
