This time dependent markov process takes on a decay term

These functions must exactly replicate the mews.stats.markov_time_dependent

python based functions


The functions here are for a very specific form of Markov process and 
will not work for a generalized transition matrix. The first row is 
assumed to be fully populated but all subsequent rows only have 2 terms
in the transitions matrix with all other terms equal to zero. A correct example
form of the transition matrix is shown below. 

M = [[0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2],
     [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
     [0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0],
     [0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0],
     [0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5]]

The input is not the transition matrix though but the cumulative distribution
function M.cumsum(axis=1)

    This function creates a Markov chain whose 2nd ... num row rows

    row n = [1-P0 + P0*f(t), 0, ...(to position n) .., 1-P0*f(t), 0, ...]

    monotonically decreases to zero or assymptotically approaches a number

    Parameters
    ----------
    cdf : a discreet cumulative probability distribution function. This will
          be altered for rows 2..num rows as indicated above
          
    rand : an array of random numbers that indicates the number of steps to
           take.
           
    state0 : the initial state of the random process
    
    coef : an array of coefficients that must be of size  (m-1)xp where 
           m is the number of states (cdf.shape[0]) and p is the number of 
           coefficients that the decay functions require. A new function
           has to be created in this module if a new function type is needed.
           for example the function "exponential_decay" has already been added
           and p = 1 since only one lambda exponent is needed.
           
           Note: The first state does not need coefficients because it is 
           assumed to be a constant markov process. Only rows 2...m have 
           time decay.
           
    func_type : an integer array that indicates what function type to use. 
           
           0 - use exponential_decay
           1 - use linear_decay
           2 - use exponential_decay with cut-off point
           3 - use linear_decay with cut-off point
           4 - use quadratic time exponential that peaks at a specific time and
               then decays. This function increases probability of sustaining
               a heat wave and then decays after the peak
           5 - use delayed exponential with cutoff.

                                         3) cutoff time at which probability drops
                                         to zero.
