        markov_chain_py(cdf, rand, state0)
        
        Evaluates a chain of markov states based on a cumulative probability matrix,
        random numbers and initial state.
        
        This function does not have Type and Value protections and should only
        be used in the context of such checks having already occured!
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        cfd : np.ndarray 
            Must be a 2-D square matrix whose elements are the 
            cumulative sum of a markov right stochastic matrix.
        rand : np.ndarray 
            1-D array of random probabilities 0 <= p <= 1.
        state0 : int, np.integer
            Integer indicating the initial markov state (determines row of cfd to
            start on). 0 <= state0 <= cfd.shape[0].
