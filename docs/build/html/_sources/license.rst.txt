 Subject: Tranlate TXT2BIN.F and BIN2TXT.F into Python and distribute as open source??
  
 Jeff,

 I have built a tool that inputs and outputs DOE-2 weather files with 
 extreme events. I use the TXT2BIN.F and BIN2TXT.F executables with 
 the version of DOE-2 that I have licensed with Hirsch and Associates. 
 I would like to be able to distribute the python libraries with these 
 executables on Github or else be able to translate the \*.F files into 
 python but know that the code is distributed under your license. 
  
 Would Hirsch and Associates be willing to let me create Python 
 versions of TXT2BIN.F and BIN2TXT.F and to distribute them as open 
 source code on GitHUB? I understand and respect Hirsch and Associateâ€™s 
 decision if this is not allowed. Thank you.
